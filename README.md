ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Welcome to q4quant.dev! I'm a student currently studying financial mathematics with the goal of becoming a quant. 

I'm a big fan of the Feynman techniqueâ€”if you can't explain something clearly, you probably don't understand it well. 

I strongly believe in learning by doing. That's why I created q4quant.dev, a companion GitHub repo featuring practical coding projects in quantitative finance. Whether you're looking for inspiration for your capstone or something cool to add to your CV, I hope you find it useful.


This repo serves as the wingman of q4quant.blog, more explanation to the projects are in the blog. Feel free to check them out and please reach out to me with no hesitation!
